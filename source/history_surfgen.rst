History of the Version of surfgen
===========================

**23/02/2020**

* 0.1.4: In this version we can adjust the orientation of the adsorbate, it will be very useful in creating surface slabs. Also we come up with a solution to assemble the location, norm vector and also the label of adsorption sites. It will make the reference much more convenient.

**22/02/2020**

* 0.1.3: In this version we add the functionalities of manipulating adsorbed atoms. And also adjust the codes to make it looks prettier.

**21/02/2020**

* 0.1.2: This version we change the parameter in slab_generator due to misread the documentation of pymatgen.

**Some days ago**

* 0.1.1: Make some adjusts about the code. Create a Github repository. Start treating it professionally.

* 0.1.0: The correct version of surfgen for finding all adsorption sites on pure metal surfaces
