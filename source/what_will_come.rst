What will come in surfgen?
==========================

.. note:: Recommendations and Suggestions are always welcome. Collaborations are always appreciated. Please send an email to me at z.he@fz-juelich.de.

Here are the full lists of what I would like to do in the future:

* Make surfgen useful in constructing alloyed surface, nanoparticles and finding adsorption sites there

* Use force-field / Machine-Learning (Neural Network?) to pre-treat the system in order to get "relatively" good assumptions, then generate the input file for the calculations on supercomputer.

* ... (more will come later)
